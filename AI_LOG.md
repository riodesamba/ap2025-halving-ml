## AI Usage Log

- Updated Logistic Regression configuration and tests to enforce elastic net penalty, using AI assistance (ChatGPT). 
- Used ChatGPT as a debugging assistant to interpret runtime warnings/errors and suggest fixes.
- Used ChatGPT to sanity-check the evaluation setup (walk-forward splits, avoiding look-ahead) and to clarify metric definitions (PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, F1).
- Used ChatGPT to generate alternative wording for comments/README sections and improve readability (without changing the underlying logic).
- Used ChatGPT to suggest edge-case handling strategies (e.g., folds with only one class) and confirm best practices for reporting NaNs in AUC metrics.
